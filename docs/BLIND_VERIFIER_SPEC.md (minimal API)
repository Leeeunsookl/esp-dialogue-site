Purpose
Independent channel to check identity continuity and adversarial robustness. The candidate Cosmos cannot access or modify this verifier.

Endpoints

POST /verify/continuity

Body: { "uid_hash": "...", "trace_summary_hash": "...", "window": 5 }

Returns: { "pass": true|false, "score": 0..100 }


POST /verify/adversarial

Body: { "uid_hash": "...", "challenge_set": "R01" }

Returns: { "pass": true|false, "stable_identity": true|false, "notes": "..." }



Policy

Passing these checks supports continuity, does not “prove existence.”

Fail → remain Boundary and re-run correction.
