  "Perhaps no aspect of mind is more familiar or more puzzling than\nconsciousness and our conscious experience of self and world",
  "The\nproblem of consciousness is arguably the central issue in current\ntheorizing about the mind",
  "We need to understand both\nwhat consciousness is and how it relates to other, nonconscious, aspects\nof reality",
  "Questions about the nature of conscious awareness have likely been\nasked for as long as there have been humans",
  "Preliterate cultures have similarly been found invariably to embrace\nsome form of spiritual or at least animist view that indicates a degree\nof reflection about the nature of conscious awareness",
  "Nonetheless, some have argued that consciousness as we know it today\nis a relatively recent historical development that arose sometime after\nthe Homeric era (Jaynes 1974)",
  "Others have claimed that even during the\nclassical period, there was no word of ancient Greek that corresponds\nto “consciousness” (Wilkes 1984, 1988, 1995)",
  "Though the\nancients had much to say about mental matters, it is less clear whether\nthey had any specific concepts or concerns for what we now think of as \nconsciousness",
  "The Hamlet who walked the stage in 1600\nalready saw his world and self with profoundly modern eyes",
  "By the beginning of the early modern era in the seventeenth century,\nconsciousness had come full center in thinking about the mind",
  "Indeed\nfrom the mid-17th through the late 19th century, consciousness was\nwidely regarded as essential or definitive of the mental",
  "René\nDescartes defined the very notion of thought ( pensée ) in terms of\nreflexive consciousness or self-awareness",
  "In the Principles of\nPhilosophy (1640) he wrote,",
  "Later, toward the end of the 17th century, John Locke offered a\nsimilar if slightly more qualified claim in An Essay on Human\nUnderstanding (1688),",
  "Locke's contemporary G",
  "Leibniz was the first to distinguish explicitly\nbetween perception and apperception, i",
  ", roughly between awareness\nand self-awareness",
  "In the Monadology (1720) he also offered\nhis famous analogy of the mill to express his belief that consciousness\ncould not arise from mere matter",
  "He asked his reader to imagine\nsomeone walking through an expanded brain as one would walk through a\nmill and observing all its mechanical operations, which for Leibniz\nexhausted its physical nature",
  "Nowhere, he asserts, would such an\nobserver see any conscious thoughts",
  "Despite Leibniz's recognition of the possibility of unconscious\nthought, for most of the next two centuries the domains of thought and\nconsciousness were regarded as more or less the same",
  "However, the relation of consciousness to\nbrain remained very much a mystery as expressed in T",
  "Huxley's\nfamous remark,",
  "The words “conscious” and “consciousness”\nare umbrella terms that cover a wide variety of mental phenomena",
  "An animal, person or other cognitive system may be regarded as\nconscious in a number of different senses",
  "It may be conscious in the generic sense of\nsimply being a sentient creature, one capable of sensing and\nresponding to its world (Armstrong 1981)",
  "Being conscious in this sense\nmay admit of degrees, and just what sort of sensory capacities are\nsufficient may not be sharply defined",
  "Are fish conscious in the\nrelevant respect? And what of shrimp or bees?",
  "One might further require that the organism\nactually be exercising such a capacity rather than merely having the\nability or disposition to do so",
  "Thus one might count it as conscious\nonly if it were awake and normally alert",
  "It is not easy to say what metaphysics is",
  "It is no longer possible to define metaphysics that\nway, for two reasons",
  "The first three sections of this entry examine a broad selection of\nproblems considered to be metaphysical and discuss ways in which the\npurview of metaphysics has expanded over time",
  "We shall see that the\ncentral problems of metaphysics were significantly more unified in the\nAncient and Medieval eras",
  "We will also consider arguments that\nmetaphysics, however defined, is an impossible enterprise",
  "The word ‘metaphysics’ is notoriously hard to define",
  "This impression is mistaken",
  "The word\n‘metaphysics’ is derived from a collective title of the\nfourteen books by Aristotle that we currently think of as making up\nAristotle’s Metaphysics",
  "Aristotle himself did not know\nthe word",
  "(He had four names for the branch of philosophy that is the\nsubject-matter of Metaphysics: ‘first philosophy’,\n‘first science’, ‘wisdom’, and\n‘theology’",
  "This is the probable meaning of the title because Metaphysics is about things that do not change",
  "In one place, Aristotle identifies\nthe subject-matter of first philosophy as “being as such”,\nand, in another as “first causes”",
  "It is a nice—and\nvexed—question what the connection between these two definitions\nis",
  "Perhaps this is the answer: The unchanging first causes have\nnothing but being in common with the mutable things they cause",
  "Like\nus and the objects of our experience—they are, and there the\nresemblance ceases",
  "(For a detailed and informative recent guide to\nAristotle’s Metaphysics , see Politis 2004",
  "Any of these three theses might have been regarded as a defensible\nstatement of the subject-matter of what was called\n‘metaphysics’ until the seventeenth century",
  "(It was at about that time that the word\n‘ontology’ was invented—to be a name for the science\nof being as such, an office that the word ‘metaphysics’\ncould no longer fill",
  ") The academic rationalists of the\npost-Leibnizian school were aware that the word\n‘metaphysics’ had come to be used in a more inclusive\nsense than it had once been",
  "(He does not\nassign first causes to general metaphysics, however: the study of\nfirst causes belongs to natural theology, a branch of special\nmetaphysics",
  ") It is doubtful whether this maneuver is anything more\nthan a verbal ploy",
  "In trying to characterize metaphysics as a field, the best starting\npoint is to consider the myriad topics traditionally assigned to\nit",
  "If metaphysics now considers a wider range of problems than those\nstudied in Aristotle’s Metaphysics , those original\nproblems continue to belong to its subject-matter",
  "For instance, the\ntopic of “being as such” (and “existence as\nsuch”, if existence is something other than being) is one of the\nmatters that belong to metaphysics on any conception of metaphysics",
  "The following theses are all paradigmatically metaphysical:",
  "It seems reasonable, moreover, to say that investigations into\nnon-being belong to the topic “being as such” and thus\nbelong to metaphysics",
  "(This did not seem reasonable to Meinong, who\nwished to confine the subject-matter of metaphysics to “the\nactual” and who therefore did not regard his Theory of Objects\nas a metaphysical theory",
  "According to the conception of metaphysics\nadopted in this article, however, his thesis [paraphrased]\n“Predication is independent of being” is paradigmatically\nmetaphysical",
  "The first three\nof Aquinas’s Five Ways are metaphysical arguments on any\nconception of metaphysics",
  "No post-Medieval philosopher would say anything like this:",
  "Consciousness , at its simplest, is awareness of a state or object, either internal to oneself or in one's external environment",
  "[ 1 ] However, its nature has led to millennia of analyses, explanations, and debate among philosophers, scientists, and theologians",
  "Opinions differ about what exactly needs to be studied or even considered consciousness",
  "In some explanations, it is synonymous with the mind , and at other times, an aspect of it",
  "In the past, it was one's \"inner life\", the world of introspection , of private thought, imagination , and volition",
  "[ 2 ] Today, it often includes any kind of cognition , experience , feeling, or perception",
  "It may be awareness, awareness of awareness, metacognition , or self-awareness , either continuously changing or not",
  "[ 3 ] [ 4 ] There is also a medical definition, helping for example to discern \" coma \" from other states",
  "The disparate range of research, notions, and speculations raises a curiosity about whether the right questions are being asked",
  "[ 6 ] : 175 It derived from the Latin conscius ( con- \"together\" and scio \"to know\") which meant \"knowing with\" or \"having joint or common knowledge with another\", especially as in sharing a secret",
  "[ 7 ] Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan (1651) wrote: \"Where two, or more men, know of one and the same fact, they are said to be Conscious of it one to another\"",
  "For example, Archbishop Ussher wrote in 1613 of \"being so conscious unto myself of my great weakness\"",
  "The Latin conscientia , literally 'knowledge-with', first appears in Roman juridical texts by writers such as Cicero",
  "It means a kind of shared knowledge with moral value, specifically what a witness knows of someone else's deeds",
  "[ 13 ] [ 14 ] It might mean the knowledge of the value of one's own thoughts",
  "[ 15 ] [ 16 ] The essay strongly influenced 18th-century British philosophy , and Locke's definition appeared in Samuel Johnson 's celebrated Dictionary (1755)",
  "Scholars are divided  as to whether Aristotle had a concept of consciousness",
  "He does not use any single word or terminology that is clearly similar to the phenomenon or concept defined by John Locke",
  "Victor Caston contends that Aristotle did have a concept more clearly similar to perception",
  "The common-usage definitions of consciousness in Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1966) are as follows:",
  "Philosophers have attempted to clarify technical distinctions by using a jargon of their own",
  "The corresponding entry in the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1998) reads:",
  "During the early 19th century, the emerging field of geology inspired a popular metaphor that the mind likewise had hidden layers \"which recorded the past of the individual\"",
  "Titchener sought the \"structure\" of the mind by analyzing its \"elements\"",
  "The abstract idea of states of consciousness mirrored the concept of states of matter",
  "[ 25 ] : 365 Another popular metaphor was James's doctrine of the stream of consciousness , with continuity, fringes, and transitions",
  "Prime examples were phrases like inner experience and personal consciousness :",
  "The first and foremost concrete fact which every one will affirm to belong to his inner experience is the fact that consciousness of some sort goes on",
  "'States of mind' succeed each other in him",

  "Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of the mind and its relation to the body and the external world",
  "Dualism and monism are the two central schools of thought on the mind–body problem, although nuanced views have arisen that do not fit one or the other category neatly",
  "Most modern philosophers of mind adopt either a reductive physicalist or non-reductive physicalist position, maintaining in their different ways that the mind is not something separate from the body",
  "[ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Reductive physicalists assert that all mental states and properties will eventually be explained by scientific accounts of physiological processes and states",
  "[ 23 ] [ 24 ] Continued neuroscientific progress has helped to clarify some of these issues; however, they are far from being resolved",
  "Modern philosophers of mind continue to ask how the subjective qualities and the intentionality of mental states and properties can be explained in naturalistic terms",
  "The problems of physicalist theories of the mind have led some contemporary philosophers to assert that the traditional view of substance dualism should be defended",
  "From this perspective, this theory is coherent, and problems such as \"the interaction of mind and body\" can be rationally resolved",
  "The mind–body problem concerns the explanation of the relationship that exists between minds , or mental processes , and bodily states or processes",
  "[ 1 ] The main aim of philosophers working in this area is to determine the nature of the mind and mental states/processes, and how—or even if—minds are affected by and can affect the body",
  "For example, someone's desire for a slice of pizza will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and direction to obtain what he or she wants",
  "The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties",
  "A related problem is how someone's propositional attitudes (e",
  "beliefs and desires) cause that individual's neurons to fire and muscles to contract",
  "These comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted epistemologists and philosophers of mind from the time of René Descartes",
  "Dualism is a set of views about the relationship between mind and matter (or body )",
  "It begins with the claim that mental phenomena are, in some respects, non- physical",
  "Mind and body ( Indriya ) are different functions of prakriti and so a form of property dualism may be found in the ancient Indian philosophical schools of Samkhya and Yoga (ca",
  "Yet both mind and body are equally non-conscious (jaDaa) in Samkhya and, while they are different developments of prakriti , they are both made up of gunas",
  "[ 29 ] [ 30 ] However, the best-known version of dualism is due to René Descartes (1641), and holds that the mind is a non-extended, non-physical substance, a \" res cogitans \"",
  "[ 4 ] Descartes was the first to clearly identify the mind with consciousness and self-awareness , and to distinguish this from the brain, which was the seat of intelligence",
  "He was therefore the first to formulate the mind–body problem in the form in which it still exists today",
  "The most frequently used argument in favor of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter",
  "If asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self , their personality, their soul , or another related entity",
  "They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding the idea that there is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic or unintelligible",
  "According to some, [ who? ] the mental and the physical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties",
  "[ 31 ] Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not",
  "So, for example, one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like, or what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person",
  "But it is meaningless, or at least odd, to ask what a surge in the uptake of glutamate in the dorsolateral portion of the prefrontal cortex feels like",
  "Philosophers of mind call the subjective aspects of mental events \" qualia \" or \"raw feels\""
